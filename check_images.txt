Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
No, the three model architectures did not classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same:
AlexNet classified Dog_01.jpg as "golden retriever"
ResNet classified Dog_01.jpg as "labrador retriever"
VGG also classified Dog_01.jpg as "labrador retriever"

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

No, the model architectures did not classify the breed of Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg to be the same:
AlexNet classified Dog_01.jpg as "golden retriever" but Dog_02.jpg as "labrador retriever"
ResNet classified Dog_01.jpg as "labrador retriever" but Dog_02.jpg as "bloodhound, sleuthhound"
VGG also classified Dog_01.jpg as "labrador retriever" but Dog_02.jpg as "bloodhound, sleuthhound"

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
The three model architectures consistently classified Animal_01.jpg as not a dog

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, 
   select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
Based on the results, all three architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) performed equally well in terms of overall accuracy, with a 25% match rate for each. They also all correctly identified the dog images as dogs 100% of the time.
However, when it comes to breed classification, Resnet and VGG classified Dog_01 as labrador retriever which was indeed the right answer. Although, they couldn't classify the same when rotated. Therefore, it is not wise to reach conclusions 
with this limited knowledge.
